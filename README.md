<summary>Installing NetHunter:</summary>

- Installation requires installed Busybox (preferably in /system/xbin), also root rights.
- Device selection for NetHunter.
- <details>
<summary>A small lyrical digression:</summary>

I think that most of you know that mobile devices have 2 main manufacturers of processors: Qualcomm and MediaTek (MTK). Some have injections (you need a qucacld-2 driver) and HID, unlike devices with chips from MTK.

Also, if you have not bought a device yet, then either choose the device where the core for NH is already ready, or order from the craftsmen for + -30 $ (2.2k‚ÇΩ), or after buying the device, assemble the core yourself.

If you are a professional pentester, then I advise you to pay attention to the devices whose main OS is Linux. For example:
- PinePhone (PDA or smartphone with Linux)
- Librem 5 (PDA or smartphone with Linux)
- Raspberry Pi (ARM based mini PC)
- Orange Pi (ARM based mini PC)

</details>

### Recommended firmware.
### Universal method for all devices.
<details>
<summary>What doesn't work without a kernel?</summary>

1. Wifi/Bluetooth/RF adapters
2. Bluetooth
3. HID/RNDIS

<details> <summary>General install process with magics</summary>  

If you want to use Kali NetHunter, you must install Busybox  on your phone, Busybox  is not provided in the kernel file, if provided then check and no need to install separately. If you want you can install Busybox  from playstore or flash Busybox  zip through magisk. I would suggest flashing the zip! 

## For Zip busybox: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Busybox-A12-blue)](https://github.com/masshuvo/Nethunter_kernel_Gauguinpro/releases/download/Busybox12/Busybox-for-Android-NDK_1.34.1_.13412.zip)
https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/busybox-ndk
https://github.com/meefik/busybox

## Download and setup some Busybox  for your phone that works on your phone: 

üñáÔ∏è

1.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox

2. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.busybox.installer

3. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.busybox


## After flashing Busybox  or after installing Busybox  from playstore and setup, you can check if Busybox  is installed on your phone with this application: 

OnePlus's Kali Nethunter Rom includes busybox, Wifi framework, provided by developers. No need to install them separately if provided by developers. 

üñáÔ∏è https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joeykrim.rootcheck


Once this is done, if you want to do wifi testing from your phone / use wifi adapter / bluetooth adapter / HID Device / Rucky / rubber ducky / USB HUMAN INTERFACE DEVICE / then flash the wifi framework zip using magisk 

 Flashing this framework zip is mandatory for doing all kinds of hardware related testing through your mobile.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
after flash kali netHunter than you need to give permissionpermission to use kali netHunter: 

<code> If there is no problem to open terminal and permission is already given in your Kali Nethunter then I don't need to follow this procedure separately!  That's why I said that there are some ROMs that are only for using Kali Nethunter, if you have downloaded and used any such ROM then you don't need to follow this procedure. </code>
**Open kali terminal**


**click Androidsu**

``` echo "FIX NETHUNTER PERMISSIONS"

echo "in Android 12"

pm grant com.offsec.nethunter android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION 

pm grant com.offsec.nethunter android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

 pm grant com.offsec.nethunter android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

 pm grant com.offsec.nethunter android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

 pm grant com.offsec.nethunter com.offsec.nhterm.permission.RUN_SCRIPT 

pm grant com.offsec.nethunter com.offsec.nhterm.permission.RUN_SCRIPT_SU

 pm grant com.offsec.nethunter com.offsec.nhterm.permission.RUN_SCRIPT_NH

 pm grant com.offsec.nethunter com.offsec.nhterm.permission.RUN_SCRIPT_NH_LOGIN

clear

sleep 3

echo "done"
```
**copy and past : Entar.**

After doing this you need to give internet permission.

**Open Kali Terminal**

**click Root**
**Copy üëá and Past and Enter:**

```groupadd -g 3003 aid_inet && usermod -G nogroup -g aid_inet _apt

echo 'APT::Sandbox::User "root";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01-android-nosandbox 
```


Before we start testing web applications' security, we need to be sure that we have all the necessary up-to-date tools. This recipe covers the basic task of keeping Kali Nethunter and its tools at their most recent versions.

How to do it...

Once you have a working instance of Kali Nethunter up and running, perform the following steps:

Log in as a root on Kali Nethunter; the default password is "toor", without the quotes. You can also use su to switch the user or sudo to execute single commands if using a regular user is preferred instead of root.

Open a terminal.

Run the apt-get update command. This will download the updated list of packages (applications and tools) that are available to install.

```apt-get update```

Once the update is finished, run the following command to update non-system packages to their last stable version:

```apt-get upgrade```

When asked to continue, press Y and then press Enter.

Next, let's upgrade our system. Type the following command and press Enter:

```apt-get dist-upgrade```
